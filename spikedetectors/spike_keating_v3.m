  %SPIKER_V3  Updated spike detection algorithm

  % ABSTHRESH = absolute threshold (uV) min spike size ##  
  % AFTDUR = in ms (after hyperpolarization wave must be longer than this)
 
  % OUT = SPIKER_V2(DATA, RATE, STARTT, INIT) returns a nx2 array of spiketimes
  % and spike amplitudes. The returned times are in seconds and the amplitudes
  % are based on the filtered amplitudes.
  %
  % [OUT PADLENGTH] = SPIKER(...) also returns the length of the padding that is
  % used for the filters. This value is the length of data that is stripped from
  % the beginning and end when INIT is true and the length that is stripped from
  % the end and added to the beginning (from previous call) when INIT is false.
  %
  % DATA should be a vector of values representing the recorded signal. The RATE
  % should be the sampling rate (i.e. 400 Hz), STARTT is the timestamp of the
  % 1st index of the DATA vector in seconds and INIT is a boolean that indicates
  % whether the filter buffers should be flushed. This is required for the first
  % time the method is called and should be set whenever the data is not
  % continuous.
  %
  % To eliminate filter artifacts on subsequent calls of the method, a
  % predetermined length of data is stored temporarily inside this method and
  % used as padding before the data in the following call. The length of the
  % padding ('npad') is determined by the sampling rate and the filter settings
  % using an approximate of the impulse response and finding the length after
  % which additional contribution are less then 0.0001 * the input.
  %
  % Because of the padding, the first and last 'npad' samples are not analyzed
  % when the INIT input is set to TRUE and the last 'npad' samples are not
  % analyzed in any scenario.
